==============
 FEP Template
==============

.. contents::
   :local:


This PEP template is a guideline of the sections that a FEP should
contain.  Extra sections may be added if appropriate, and unnecessary
sections may be noted as such.

Status
======

FEPs go through a number of phases in their lifetime:

- **Discussion**: The FEP is being actively discussed on the mailing
  list and it is being improved by its author.  The mailing list
  discussion of the FEP should include the FEP number (FEPxxx) in the
  subject line so they can be easily related to the FEP.

- **Progress**: Consensus was reached on the mailing list and
  implementation work has begun.

- **Completed**: The implementation has been merged into master.

- **Superseded**: This FEP has been abandoned in favor of another
  approach.

Branches and Pull requests
==========================

All development branches containing work on this FEP should be linked to from here.

All pull requests submitted relating to this FEP should be linked to
from here.  (A FEP does not need to be implemented in a single pull
request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).

Abstract
========

The abstract should be a short description of what the FEP will achieve.

Detailed description
====================

This section describes the need for the FEP.  It should describe the
existing problem that it is trying to solve and why this FEP makes the
situation better.  It should include examples of how the new
functionality would be used and perhaps some use cases.

Implementation
==============

This section lists the major steps required to implement the FEP.
Where possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on
another, and which steps may be optionally omitted.  Where it makes
sense, each step should include a link related pull requests as the
implementation progresses.

Backward compatibility
======================

This section describes the ways in which the FEP breaks backward incompatibility.

Alternatives
============

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem,
they should be discussed here, along with a justification for the
chosen approach.
