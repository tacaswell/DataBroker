v0.6.0
------

Bug Fixes
+++++++++

Make ``get_table`` properly respect its ``stream_name`` argument. (Previously
any value but default returned an empty result.)

Enhancements
++++++++++++

* Allow ``Broker`` to be imported without configuration present.
* Add stateful "filters" to restrict searches.
* Add aliases to save searches during a session.
* Overhaul documents and tests.

API Changes
+++++++++++

* The default value of ``stream_name`` in ``get_events`` is now ``ALL``, a
  sentinel value. (The default for ``get_table`` is still ``'primary'``, but it
  now also accepts ``ALL``.)
